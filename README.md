The Temperature Converter is a graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to facilitate the conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin temperature scales. The application allows users to input a temperature value in either Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin and instantly view the corresponding values in the other two scales. The conversion logic is implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for creating the user interface.
